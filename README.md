# tressureHunt
A console-based adventure game in C where the player moves along a hidden path. You must explore tiles, collect treasures ðŸ’Ž, and avoid bombs ðŸ’£ while managing your limited lives and moves.
Each move uncovers whatâ€™s on that tile (nothing, treasure, bomb, or both).
Already visited tiles are marked so you donâ€™t waste moves.
The game ends when you run out of lives or moves.

**How to Run**

gcc treasure_hunt.c -o treasure_hunt
./treasure_hunt
